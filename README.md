## Get userâ€™s country name and country flag based on his ip address

![](screenshots/location.png)

I have used 3 api to do project:

1. [jsonapi](https://jsonip.com) to get user ip address.
2. [ipapi](https://ipapi.co/) to get the country code based on the ip address return by jsonapi
3. [restcountries](https://restcountries.eu) to get country name and flag based on the code.
