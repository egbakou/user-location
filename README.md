## Get user’s country name and country flag based on his IP address

![](screenshots/location.png)

I have used 3 API to do this project:

1. [api.ipify](https://api.ipify.org/?format=json) to get user’s IP address.
2. [ipapi](https://ipapi.co/) to get the country code based on the IP address return by ipify.
3. [restcountries](https://restcountries.eu) to get country name and flag based on the code.
